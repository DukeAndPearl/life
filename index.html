      Hi, there. I'm Duke. I'm a Christian, a son, a husband, a father, too.<br /><br />


      I was born on the beautiful Loess Plateau of north-western China at the end of 1994. I like eat noodles, and
      steamed
      bread and various cakes. My favorite vegetables are potatoes, celery and various soy products. And I like spicy
      food.<br /><br />


      As for sports, I like to run, play pingpong and badminton, and shoot basketball. Sometimes I'm more rational, and
      sometimes I'm more emotional. Depends if I'm doing technical analysis or improvising.<br /><br />

      Due to my family background, I studied psychology and later obtained the qualification certificate for
      psychological
      counseling. I studied computer science and technology in college. That's really a rich discipline, including
      computer
      principles, data structures and algorithms, computer networks, computer vision, various programming languages,
      databases, and more. After graduation, I became an R&D engineer and participated in developing aircraft engine
      health
      management system in the world's seventh largest civil airline.<br /><br />

      At the same time, I love literature and art. When I have free time, I will read some faith-related books and
      literature. I have been writing poetry since the third grade until now. Aside from poetry, my favorite is
      “nonfiction”. As for art, I love watching movies and photography. I take thousands of photos every
      year.<br /><br />

      Another big hobby of mine is cyberspace security, including information security, network security, privacy
      security,
      and so on. I put a lot of effort into this. Initially, I participated in various online and offline activities,
      read
      various articles related to it, and joined various group chats, all for learning. Later, I came up with some ideas
      myself, so I wrote them down and published them on media platforms. I also got the certificate of China Certified
      Information Security Engineer.<br /><br />

      An interest in privacy begins with a focus on data security. Privacy-related data falls into the most special
      category
      of these. Later, I took the EXIN DPO certificate to systematically consolidate my privacy knowledge. After that, I
      joined ByteDance to practice and validate the validity of what I've learned.<br /><br />

      As I mentioned above, my biggest hobby is writing and it has lasted for many years. Here are some articles related
      to
      psychology, law, security, and privacy.<br /><br />
